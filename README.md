Overview
The Event Reservation System (ERS) is designed to streamline the booking, organization, and management of events. The system handles entities such as Events, Venues, Organizers, Audience, Tickets, Revenue, and Feedback, enabling robust data organization, easy queries for analytics, and secure storage of event-related data.

Features
Event Scheduling: Efficiently schedule different event types with date and time.

Venue Management: Allocate venues with capacity, location, and cost handling.

Organizer Coordination: Manage organizer details including contact, email, and address.

Audience Registration: Track attendees for each event with personal and contact details.

Ticketing System: Monitor ticket availability, sales, and prices for each event.

Revenue Monitoring: Track revenue generated by events.

Feedback Analysis: Record and analyze feedback from audience and organizers.

ER Diagram
The full ER diagram for the project is included in /ER.drawio.pdf.

Entities:

Event

Venue

Audience

Organizer

Ticket

Revenue

Feedback

Relationships:

Events take place at a Venue, are attended by Audiences, organized by Organizers, generate Revenue, and receive Feedback.

Tickets connect Audiences and Events.

Feedback can be given by Audiences for Events (optionally referencing Organizers).

Database Schema
Tables (with major columns):

Venue: venue_id, state, city, location, capacity, cost

Event: event_id, event_type, event_datetime, venue_id

Audience: audience_id, fname, lname, age, contact, email

Organisers: organiser_id, full_name, address, contact, email

Tickets: ticket_id, event_id, audience_id, price, availability

Revenue: revenue_id, amount, event_id, venue_id, organiser_id

Feedback: feedback_id, comment, rating, event_id, audience_id, organiser_id

Normalization steps are described in detail in /ERS-Project-Report.pdf.

Normalization
The database satisfies the following normal forms:

1NF: No repeating groups/multivalued columns.

2NF: All non-key attributes fully functionally dependent on the whole primary key.

3NF: No transitive dependency between non-key attributes.

BCNF, 4NF, 5NF: Achieved as per the ERD and further decompositions.

For normalization details, see the project report.

Sample Queries
Some example SQL queries for project use-cases are:

1. Revenue by Event Type

sql
SELECT E.event_type, SUM(R.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Revenue R
JOIN Event E ON R.event_id = E.event_id
GROUP BY E.event_type;
2. Audience List for an Event

sql
SELECT A.fname, A.lname
FROM Tickets T
JOIN Audience A ON T.audience_id = A.audience_id
WHERE T.event_id = 1;
3. Available Tickets per Event

sql
SELECT E.event_id, E.event_type, COUNT(T.ticket_id) AS available_tickets
FROM Tickets T
JOIN Event E ON T.event_id = E.event_id
WHERE T.availability = 'Available'
GROUP BY E.event_id, E.event_type;
See the project report for more detailed query examples and sample outputs.

This project was developed under the mentorship of Dr. Ashu Sharma, Department of Electronics and Communication, Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.

Note:
This project is intended for academic use. All database architectures, designs, and queries are for demonstration and learning purposes.

You may include schema files, Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts, and sample datasets in the repository for easier reproducibility. If thereâ€™s a web interface or code for CRUD operations, mention setup/usage instructions as well.
